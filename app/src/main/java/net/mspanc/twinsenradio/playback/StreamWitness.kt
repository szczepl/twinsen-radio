/**
 * Sets the stream against the title API, for a station where the API alone
 * decides what is on screen. Nothing here changes what the driver sees - it
 * only says whether the two agree and how far apart they said it, so the trace
 * can tell when (if ever) the stream is worth listening to again.
 *
 * **Why the stream has no say.** Until 30.10.2026 a `TitleArbiter` let the
 * stream take over once it named a real track. RNS's stream broke three ways
 * in four days, each defeating the rule written for the one before: Revma's
 * placeholder (27.10), a fixed "Radio Nowy Swiat - Pion i poziom!" on connect
 * (27.10, 18:12), and on 30.10 a frozen real track - every mount sends
 * "Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross - Normal Life" once on connect and then
 * nothing. That one *looks* like proof of a working stream, so the arbiter
 * trusted it, covered the API's correct track with it for 3 minutes, and then
 * let each next API change wait 60 s for the stream to follow - twice that
 * morning a title came 76-78 s late. The station's own app plays the same
 * mounts and shows what its API says; so do we now.
 *
 * All times are on one monotonic clock, passed in, so this is pure logic.
