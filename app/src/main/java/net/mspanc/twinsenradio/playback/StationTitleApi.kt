/**
 * "Now playing" for stations whose stream stopped saying it.
 *
 * Radio Nowy Swiat moved its studio to Minska street (October 2026) and
 * since then every one of its mounts - 256, 128, the backup 128 and the AAC -
 * sends `StreamTitle='Now Playing info goes here'`, which is the hosting
 * platform's (Revma) placeholder: nobody feeds the encoder a title any more.
 * Their web player never read ICY in the first place - it polls
 * `/api/oZeta/stat` every ten seconds - so the title is still on their site and
 * in their app, just not in the stream (measured 27.10.2026). Their mobile app
 * uses `/api/Mobile/...`, but that sits behind a Cloudflare challenge that a
 * plain client doesn't pass; the web endpoint answers anybody.
 *
 * What comes back is turned into an ordinary StreamTitle, so everything
 * downstream - slogans, ads, the catalogue, the stale deadline - treats it
 * exactly like a block from the stream and needs to know nothing about where
 * it came from.
