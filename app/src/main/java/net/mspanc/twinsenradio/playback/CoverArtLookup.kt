/**
 * Looks up cover art for the track currently playing.
 *
 * How we know this is the right approach: the ICY stream **carries no artwork
 * at all** - it only ever carries text (StreamTitle and optionally StreamUrl).
 * Stations bolt cover art on client-side by querying an external catalogue.
 * Radio Nowy Swiat's web player does exactly what's below - its
 * `neoplayer-min.js` contains:
 *
 *     $.ajax({ url: `https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=${title} ${artist}&media=music` })
 *
 * The iTunes catalogue is free, needs no key or registration, and returns the
 * artwork address in the artworkUrl100 field, which can be swapped for a
 * higher resolution.
 *
 * Fallbacks in case hits are poor: MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive (free,
 * slower), Deezer API (free), Last.fm and Spotify (require a key).
